The slide then shows the correct way: **`(CustomName, Name) -> Custom`**.

This means you need **both** `CustomName` and `Name` together to uniquely determine the value of `Custom`. Knowing just one or the other is not enough.

Because `Custom` depends on the **entire** primary key `{CustomName, Name}`, we say that `Custom` is **fully functionally dependent** on the primary key.
