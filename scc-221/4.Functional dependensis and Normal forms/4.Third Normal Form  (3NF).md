Think of it as a rule that every column in a table should be about the primary key, and nothing but the primary key.

The core rule of BCNF is very simple: for any non-trivial functional dependency (`X -> A`), the determinant (`X`) **must be a superkey**. A superkey is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row.![[Pasted image 20251023213249.png]]
