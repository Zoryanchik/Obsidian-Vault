But we have redundancy here.. Third and Fourth Entities are the same!

To avoid having duplicate entities, we need to be able to identify each row uniquely…And, so select an attribute that distinguishes an entity within the Car entity set.

Model uniquely identifies an entity (the whole row) within this entity set.
	The attribute that uniquely identifies entities within the entity set is called a ‘key attribute’.

Derived attributes are given using dashed lines. They are imaginary, i.e., they are not given in the table.
