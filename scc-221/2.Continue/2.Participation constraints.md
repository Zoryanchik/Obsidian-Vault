**Participation** describes whether _every instance_ of one entity **must** be related to an instance of another entity in a relationship.

- **Total participation** → _Every entity must participate_ in the relationship.  
    (i.e., no entity is left out — mandatory relationship)
    
- **Partial participation** → _Some entities may not participate_.  
    (i.e., participation is optional — not every instance is linked)
