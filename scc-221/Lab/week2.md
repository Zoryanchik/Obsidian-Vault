1) There are X's with g (primary key), h, and i's and Y's with j (primary key), k, and l's. X's and Y's are related to each other and an X is related to at least one Y and an Y may be related to X's.

2) There are P's with x (primary key), y, and z's and Q's with m (primary key), n, and o's. P's and Q's are related to each other and a Q must be related to at least one P and a P must be related to at least one Q.

3) There are U's with v (primary key), w, and x's and V's with y (primary key), z, and a's. U's and V's are related to each other via many to many relation.

4) There are C's with d (primary key), e, and f's and D's with g (primary key), h, and i's. C's and D's are related to each other via one to one relation, where for any C there must be a D.
