**Limited Direct Execution (LDE)** is a CPU management technique that lets **user programs run directly on the CPU** (for speed), but under **controlled limits** (for safety).

Limited direct code execution allows the OS scheduler to control process scheduling. • Processes use system calls to access virtualized resources. • Timer interrupts enable the OS to schedule processes.
