Cloud computing is an IT paradigm that functions similarly to a public utility (like electricity or gas). Instead of owning hardware, users access shared pools of configurable resources over the Internet.

- **Definition:** It enables ubiquitous access to resources (servers, storage, applications) that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort.
    
- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - **On-demand & Self-service:** Users access resources as needed without human intervention.
        
    - **Elasticity:** Resources can scale up or down dynamically to match workload demand (e.g., handling traffic spikes).
        
    - **Pay-per-usage:** Usage is metered, and users are charged only for what they consume (OpEx instead of CapEx).
        
    - **Resource Pooling:** Provider resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers (multi-tenancy).
