While beneficial, cloud computing introduces significant risks.

#### **A. Security & Responsibility**

- **Shared Responsibility Model:**
    
    - **Provider (e.g., AWS):** Responsible for security **OF** the cloud (Hardware, Regions, Compute, Storage infrastructure).
        
    - **Customer:** Responsible for security **IN** the cloud (Customer Data, IAM, Firewall config, OS patching).
        
- **De-perimeterisation:** Systems span multiple boundaries, making it hard to track responsibility during security incidents.
    
- **Privacy:** Data is stored across global jurisdictions with different privacy laws, affected by cultural views on privacy.

#### **B. Operational Challenges**

- **Vendor Lock-in:** Moving data/apps between providers is difficult due to diverse interfaces and data transfer bottlenecks.
    
- **Availability:** Outages (e.g., Cloudflare issues) can take down services globally.
    
- **Performance:** "Noisy neighbors" (resource sharing) can lead to unpredictable performance.

#### **C. Sustainability**

- **Energy Consumption:** Cloud datacenters consume **240-340 TWh** per year (~1% of global demand).
    
- **AI Impact:** AI-optimized servers are pushing energy demand up sharply.
    
- **Water Usage:** Cooling systems put pressure on local water resources.
    
- **E-Waste:** Frequent hardware upgrades create significant electronic waste.#
