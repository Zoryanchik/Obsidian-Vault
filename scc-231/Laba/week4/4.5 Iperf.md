**Question:**  
Which network metrics can be measured using a **TCP iperf client**?

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**

**c. Throughput or bandwidth**

### 💡 **Explanation:**

- `iperf` with **TCP** measures **throughput (bandwidth)** using a TCP connection between client and server.
    
- TCP ensures reliability and flow control, so **packet loss and jitter are not directly measured**, but retransmissions (shown as “Retr”) can indicate congestion.
    
- **Hop count** isn’t measured at all by iperf.**Question:**  
Which network metrics can be measured using a **UDP iperf client**? _(Select two)_

### ✅ **Correct Answers:**

**a. Packet loss**  
**b. Jitter**  
**(c. Throughput or bandwidth)** — often also displayed, but typically the question expects **a and b** as the key _additional metrics_ over TCP.

### 💡 **Explanation:**

- **UDP** mode (`-u`) allows iperf to measure:
    
    - **Throughput (bitrate)** — based on how much UDP data is received per second.
        
    - **Packet loss** — since UDP has no retransmissions, any missing datagrams are counted.
        
    - **Jitter** — variation in packet inter-arrival times.
        
- **Hop count** still isn’t measured.
    

If the question explicitly says “Select two,” then the best answers are:  
➡️ **(a) Packet loss** and **(b) Jitter**.When you limit the link between `h4` and `s3` with `bw=100`, what new bandwidth does the client report?

### ✅ **Correct Answer:**

**d. ~90 Mbps**

### 💡 **Explanation:**

- You set a **bandwidth cap** of 100 Mbps in the topology:
    
    `self.addLink(h4, s3, bw=100)`
    
- When you rerun TCP iperf, the **measured throughput** is slightly below that cap (around 90–95 Mbps) due to:
    
    - TCP overhead,
        
    - buffering delays, and
        
    - protocol inefficiencies.
        

So the measured result is typically **~90 Mbps**, not a full 100 Mbps.![[Pasted image 20251103194322.png]]
