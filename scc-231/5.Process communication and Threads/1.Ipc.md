- **How it Works:** Processes exchange data by sending messages through OS-managed channels, like pipes, sockets, or queues.
    
- **Analogy:** This is like sending letters through the post office. The OS is the postal service, managing the channel and ensuring delivery. The processes don't interact directly.
    
- **Pros:** It's simpler and safer, as the OS manages the communication.
    
- **Cons:** It's generally slower because every message requires a system call (kernel overhead) to send or receive.
