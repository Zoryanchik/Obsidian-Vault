- **No Sharing:** That specific path's resources are not shared with any other call.
    
- **Guaranteed Performance:** This dedicated line means there's no congestion from other users on that circuit.
    
- **Inefficient:** If the computers aren't sending data, the circuit sits idle, wasting capacity.
    
- **Example:** This is how traditional telephone networks operated.
