### A) Harry Potter Clip: HCI Design Concepts

_Focus: First 2 minutes 40 seconds_

In this scene, Harry’s interaction with the wands mirrors a user’s interaction with an unfamiliar interface.

- **Affordances:**
    
    - **The Wand:** Its long, thin shape and handle-like base _afford_ gripping and waving in the air.
        
    - **The Ladder:** The rails and rungs _afford_ climbing, which Ollivander uses to navigate the shelves.
        
    - **The Boxes:** The rectangular shape and lid _afford_ opening to reveal the contents.
        
- **Signifiers:**
    
    - **The Shop Sign:** The "Ollivanders" sign outside _signifies_ the purpose of the building to the characters and the viewer.
        
    - **The Counter:** The large, clear surface in the middle of the shop _signifies_ where the "transaction" or interaction should take place.
        
    - **Labels on Boxes:** Small labels on the wand boxes _signify_ specific data about the wand inside (like wood type or core).
        
- **Constraints:**
    
    - **Physical Constraints:** The narrow aisles between high shelves _constrain_ Harry’s movement, forcing him to stay at the counter.
        
    - **Cultural/Logical Constraints:** Harry understands he shouldn't just grab a wand; he must wait for the "expert" to provide one, mirroring how a system might restrict certain actions until a prerequisite is met.
        
- **Feedback:**
    
    - **Destructive Feedback:** When Harry waves the first two wands, they cause immediate physical destruction (shattering a vase or blowing up drawers). This is a clear, immediate (though negative) system response to his action.
        
    - **Positive Feedback:** When Harry finds the correct wand, the music swells, a light shines on him, and a gentle breeze blows. This provides sensory confirmation that he has successfully completed the task.

### B) Jakob’s Law & The Eight Golden Rules

**Jakob's Law** states that users spend most of their time on _other_ sites. Therefore, they prefer your site to work the same way as all the others they already know.

This relates directly to **Rule #1: Strive for Consistency**.

- By following common conventions (like putting a logo in the top left or a cart in the top right), you reduce the user’s cognitive load.
    
- If you break this consistency, users have to "relearn" how to use your interface, which leads to frustration and a higher likelihood of **Slips** (as discussed in your earlier questions).

### C) The Four Principles of Accessibility (POUR)

_Explained for a general Computer Science audience:_

1. **Perceivable (Can I see/hear it?):** Information shouldn't be hidden from any of the senses. For example, if you have an image, you must provide a text description (`alt-text`) so a blind user's screen reader can "read" it. If you have a video, you need captions so a deaf user can "hear" it.
    
2. **Operable (Can I use it?):** The interface must be navigable. A user should be able to do everything with just a keyboard (no mouse needed) or via voice command. It also means avoiding things like flashing lights that could cause seizures.
    
3. **Understandable (Does it make sense?):** The content and the way the UI works must be logical. Users shouldn't be confused by what a button does or how to fill out a form. The language should be clear, and the navigation should be predictable.
    
4. **Robust (Does it work everywhere?):** Your code must be clean and follow standards so that it works on all browsers and with all "assistive technologies" (like screen readers). It should be "tough" enough to stay functional even as technology evolves.
