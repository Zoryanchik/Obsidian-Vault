![[Pasted image 20251017172801.png]]1. Early Interfaces (1940s–60s)
- Batch processing: punch cards, no direct interaction
- Command line: text commands, needed expert users
2. GUIs (1970s–80s)
- Xerox PARC: windows, icons, mouse
- Apple and Microsoft made GUIs popular
- Direct manipulation: click and drag instead of typing
3. Post-GUI (1990s–2000s)
- Web: browsers, links, multimedia
- Mobile: small screens, touch, simple design
4. Modern Interfaces (2010s–present)
- Touch and gestures: swipe, pinch, tap
- Voice: Siri, Alexa, chatbots
- AR/VR: immersive 3D worlds
- Wearables/IoT: smart devices everywhere
5. Trends
- Shift to user-centered design
- Focus on usability and accessibility
- Interfaces keep evolving with new technology

| **1 sec**            | Conversational gap; reaction time                | Progress indicators should appear if an operation takes longer. Short delays are acceptable but noticeable.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **10 sec**           | Unbroken concentration                           | Time to complete one task step (e.g., a wizard). Beyond this, attention may wander.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **1–2 Hours**        | Attention span, cognitive fatigue                | Typical length of usability testing or extended online activity. Most users tired after 1–2 hours, so long tasks should allow breaks, autosave progress, and clear navigation. Web sessions (like shopping or research) often finish within an hour; design should support **task completion without fatigue**. |

c)
Having a single light that changes colour could confuse drivers because all the colours come from the same bulb. It may be difficult to tell which colour is showing in bright light or from a distance, which increases the risk of accidents. Standard three-light is more safe.

d)
The Bezold effect occurs when a colour appears to change due to the colours around it. Changing one colour in a design can alter how all the surrounding colours are perceived.

In UI/visualisation, for example, choosing button or text colours that sit next to large background blocks can make a grey button appear lighter or darker depending on the surrounding hues. Colour scales in charts or heatmaps must be carefully tuned to avoid misinterpretation due to this effect.

f)Proximity Principle

Rationale: The grouping of items in columns (navigation pane, folder list, file list) is based on their physical proximity. Items in each list (e.g., all file names) are perceived as a single, related group because of their close proximity. This is fundamental to understanding the structure of folders and files.
