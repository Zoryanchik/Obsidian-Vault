![[Pasted image 20251017172801.png]]1. Early Interfaces (1940s–60s)
- Batch processing: punch cards, no direct interaction
- Command line: text commands, needed expert users
2. GUIs (1970s–80s)
- Xerox PARC: windows, icons, mouse
- Apple and Microsoft made GUIs popular
- Direct manipulation: click and drag instead of typing
3. Post-GUI (1990s–2000s)
- Web: browsers, links, multimedia
- Mobile: small screens, touch, simple design
4. Modern Interfaces (2010s–present)
- Touch and gestures: swipe, pinch, tap
- Voice: Siri, Alexa, chatbots
- AR/VR: immersive 3D worlds
- Wearables/IoT: smart devices everywhere
5. Trends
- Shift to user-centered design
- Focus on usability and accessibility
- Interfaces keep evolving with new technology
