You are comparing the standard linear equation from your chart ($y = mx + c$) with the Fitts's Law equation ($MT = b \times ID + a$).

- **Chart Equation:** $y = 9.1271x - 1.1057$
    
- **Fitts's Law Equation:** $MT = a + b \times ID$
    

The instructions tell you that $y = MT$ and $x = ID$. If you substitute those into your chart equation, you get:

$$MT = 9.1271 \times ID - 1.1057$$

By comparing this directly to the Fitts's Law formula ($MT = a + b \times ID$), you can find the constants:

- **a = -1.1057** (This is the y-intercept, or the constant $a$)
    
- **b = 9.1271** (This is the slope, or the constant $b$)

### What This Means

- **R² Value:** The $R^2 = 0.8455$ means that **84.55%** of the variation in the Movement Time ($MT$) is predicted by the Index of Difficulty ($ID$). As your instructions note, this is quite close to 1, indicating a **good fit** for the model. This suggests that the task strongly conforms to Fitts's Law.
