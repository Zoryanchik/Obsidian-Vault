These patterns are categorized based on the standard types defined by [deceptive.design](https://www.deceptive.design/types)11.

### Part 1: Analysis of Examples

#### Example 1: Reddit Mobile Web Site ("Unlimited Cats")

- **Deceptive Pattern:** **Confirmshaming**22.
    
- **Reasoning:** The interface attempts to guilt the user into a specific action. To decline using the app, the user must click a button that says **"I'm a dog person"**3. This frames the choice as a character flaw or an irrelevant preference rather than a simple "No thanks," making the user feel slightly "incorrect" for opting out4.
    

#### Example 2: Reddit Mobile Web Site ("See this post")

- **Deceptive Pattern:** **Visual Interference** and **Obstruction**55.
    
- **Reasoning:** The interface presents two choices: "Open" (for the app) and "Continue" (for the browser)6. The app option is often highlighted or given a more prominent "primary" button style, while the browser option is made to look like a secondary or less desirable path, obstructing the user's original goal of simply viewing the content in their current browser7.
    

#### Example 3: Adobe Cloud vs. Local Saving

- **Deceptive Pattern:** **Visual Interference**88.
    
- **Reasoning:** The comparison table is heavily weighted to make "Local Saving" (on your computer) look inferior by using empty circles (indicating missing features) compared to the green checkmarks for "Creative Cloud"9999. Additionally, the button to "Save to Creative Cloud" is highlighted in blue, while the "Save on your computer" button is plain/outlined, nudging the user toward the subscription service10101010.
    

#### Example 4: Adobe Acrobat Reader Mobile (Free vs. Premium)

- **Deceptive Pattern:** **Roach Motel** and **Forced Continuity**11111111.
    
- **Reasoning:** This screen pushes a "7-day free trial"12. These often utilize a "Roach Motel" pattern where it is very easy to get into the subscription (one click), but intentionally difficult to cancel later. It also uses **Visual Interference** by placing the "Premium" benefits and "Start trial" button in the most prominent visual space, while the "X" to close or stay on the free version is often small, faint, or tucked in a corner13.

### Part 2: Personal Examples (Exercise 2)

For your lab session, you need to provide your own examples14141414. Here are two common ones you can screenshot and use:

1. **"Hidden Costs" in Delivery Apps (e.g., UberEats/DoorDash):** * **Pattern:** **Hidden Costs**.
    
    - **Why:** You see one price at the start, but by the time you reach the final checkout, service fees and delivery fees have been added that weren't clearly disclosed upfront.
        
2. **"Pre-selected" Add-ons in Travel Sites (e.g., Ryanair/Expedia):**
    
    - **Pattern:** **Preselection**.
        
    - **Why:** When booking a flight, "Travel Insurance" or "Extra Legroom" is often automatically checked/selected for you. You have to actively find the button to "opt-out."

**Would you like me to help you find the specific definitions for the mobile/3D game patterns mentioned in the ACM papers cited in your worksheet?** 15

|**Pattern**|**Description**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Confirmshaming**|Emotionally manipulating a user into doing something by using guilt or shame.|A button to decline a discount that reads: "No thanks, I'm a dog person" or "I hate saving money".|
|**Visual Interference**|Using design elements like color, size, or placement to hide or obscure information users expect to see.|Making a "Cancel" button faint grey while the "Keep Subscription" button is bright blue.|
|**Obstruction**|Creating barriers or "hurdles" that make it hard for users to complete a task, such as closing an account.|Making it easy to sign up but requiring multiple clicks, obscure menus, or a phone call to cancel.|
|**Forced Action**|Requiring a user to do something unrelated and undesirable to achieve their original goal.|Forcing a user to take a survey before they are allowed to opt-out of data collection.|
|**Hidden Costs**|Revealing unexpected fees (taxes, shipping, or service fees) only at the final step of checkout.|A flight that starts at $100 but jumps to $160 at the final payment screen due to "service charges".|
|**Preselection**|Presenting a default option that is already selected to influence the user's decision.|A "Sign up for marketing emails" box that is checked by default.|
|**Trick Wording**|Using confusing language or double negatives to mislead a user into taking an unintended action.|A checkbox that says: "Do not uncheck this box if you want to keep receiving emails".|
|**Roach Motel**|A design that is extremely easy to "check into" (sign up) but nearly impossible to "check out" of (cancel).|A subscription service that takes one click to join but requires a physical letter or long chat to leave.|
