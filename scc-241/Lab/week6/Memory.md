# Memory
![[Pasted image 20251119182555.png]]
A)      We talked about George Miller’s “Magical Number Seven Plus Minus Two”. In the article (which can be found at https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/), Miller discussed that the memory span of young adults is approximately seven items. He noticed that memory span is approximately the same for stimuli with vastly different amounts of information—for instance, binary digits have 1 bit each; decimal digits have 3.32 bits each; words have about 10 bits each. Miller concluded that memory span is not limited in terms of bits but in terms of ‘**chunks’**.

B)    Many designers refer to “The Magical Number Seven Plus Minus Two” as Miller’s Law, and argue that because of Miller’s observation, we should limit the number of items in lists and of options in menus to 7 ± 2. Does that make sense? Provide a short critical discussion about this interpretation of Miller’s observation.

(max. 50 words).

No, because Miller was studying humans memory, not how users use interface or produce decision. Also, user is not required to memorise interface when using the menus. At additional, if items are properly sorted, few items could be part of one chunk, so it will be possible to memorise more than 7 ± 2

C)    Read the NN group article on Spatial Memory: https://[www.nngroup.com/articles/spatial-](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/spatial-) memory/

Give an example of how you use spatial memory when using a smartphone. For the same context, describe how spatial memory could become disrupted. (50 words)

When using a smartphone, we rely on spatial memory to know where apps sit on the home screen.For example, tapping the lower-right corner to open Messages without searching. This memory becomes disrupted if app icons rearrange .

D)    Go to https://major-system.info/ to learn about the Major System. Use the system to encode your student ID as a series of words! Which is easier to remember, the number or the words?

**Words**

# Attention

E)    According to Multiple Resource Theory (MRT), there are some tasks that we can attend at the same time because they draw on different cognitive resources. For each of the following scenarios, consider if the two tasks can be performed in parallel, with divided attention. Answer yes/no and explain your answer with reference to the MRT model:

i.        ![](file:///C:/Users/zorya/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg)Reading an article in your web browser // Noticing a notification in the corner of your screen together with a sound alert.

**Yes, Visual and Audio resources**

ii.      Reading an article, as above // Noticing a notification arriving with an animation in the screen corner

**No, both are using visual resources**

iii.    Reading an article, as above // Recognising that a notification in the screen corner is an alert by the OS

**No, both are visual**

iv.    On the map recognising which coffee place is nearest // recognising the name of the nearest coffee place

**No, both are visual**
