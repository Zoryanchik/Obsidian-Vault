## Memory Exercises

**A) Miller's Magical Number** The answer is: **chunks** (or "chunks of information")

Miller concluded that memory span is limited by the number of meaningful units or chunks, not by the amount of information in bits.

**B) Critical Discussion of "Miller's Law" (50 words)**

This interpretation oversimplifies Miller's work. Miller studied _memory span_ for immediate recall, not interface design. Modern research shows working memory is closer to 4±1 chunks. More importantly, good interface design depends on organization, hierarchy, and recognition (not recall). Grouping items logically matters more than arbitrary number limits.

**C) Spatial Memory Example (50 words)**

_Using spatial memory:_ I remember my messaging app is in the bottom-right of my home screen, and Settings is top-left, allowing me to find them without reading labels.

_Disruption:_ Spatial memory breaks when apps auto-rearrange after updates, or when switching to a new phone with different screen size/layout, forcing me to consciously search again.

**D) Major System Exercise**

I can help you encode your student ID! What is your student ID number? Once you provide it, I'll show you how to convert it using the Major System (which converts digits into consonant sounds, then into memorable words).

## Attention Exercises

**E) Multiple Resource Theory Analysis:**

**i. Reading article // Noticing notification with sound**

- **YES** - Can be performed in parallel
- Different modalities: visual (reading) vs. auditory (sound alert). Visual notification is peripheral, unlikely to interfere with focal reading. MRT shows auditory and visual channels are separate resources.

**ii. Reading article // Noticing animated notification**

- **PARTIALLY/DIFFICULT** - Significant interference likely
- Both require visual processing resources. The animation competes for visual attention with the text you're reading. Though the notification is peripheral, animation draws attention away from focal reading task.

**iii. Reading article // Recognizing OS alert notification**

- **NO** - Difficult to perform simultaneously
- Both require visual processing AND cognitive processing (reading text vs. recognizing/interpreting notification). Recognition requires shifting attention from reading to identify the notification type—cannot truly be done simultaneously.

**iv. Recognizing nearest coffee place // Recognizing its name**

- **NO** - Cannot be truly simultaneous
- Both are visual-spatial tasks using the same cognitive resources. You must process spatial location (visual-spatial) then shift to process text/name (visual-verbal). These are sequential, not parallel, though they may feel quick.
