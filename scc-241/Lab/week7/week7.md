## **Modelling Action**

### **A) Skills, Rules, Knowledge**

**Skills level:** Automatic, well-learned actions performed without conscious thought.  
**Example:** The system automatically activates the water pump as soon as the water level drops.

**Rules level:** Actions carried out by following predefined instructions or “if–then” logic.  
**Example:** If the temperature rises above a set threshold, the system turns on the air conditioner.

**Knowledge level:** Actions requiring reasoning, problem-solving, or interpretation of new situations.  
**Example:** The AI analyses plant images and uses diagnostic reasoning to assess overall plant health.

### **B) Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation**

**Gulf of Execution:** The difficulty users face when trying to figure out how to perform an action or tell the system what they intend to do.

**Gulf of Evaluation:** The difficulty users face when trying to understand the system’s feedback—what happened, why it happened, and whether their goal was met.

**Why execution and evaluation are interdependent:**  
The user’s ability to act depends on their understanding of the system’s state, and their ability to interpret the system’s state depends on the actions they take. If a user can’t evaluate what happened, they won’t know what action to take next; if they can’t execute an action correctly, they won’t receive feedback that helps them confirm progress toward their goal.

### **C) Example Usability Problem + Analysis**

(_Your instructor asks you to bring a photo/screenshot to the seminar; here is a polished written version of what you wrote._)

**Step 1 – Description of the problem**  
Recently, I used a user interface where the status icon was ambiguous. For example, I tried connecting Bluetooth headphones and saw an icon that looked active, but the headphones were not actually paired.

**Step 2 – Analysis using Norman’s action cycle and the two gulfs**

- **Gulf of Execution:** It wasn’t clear which action I needed to take next—tap the icon, open a submenu, or refresh the device list.
    
- **Gulf of Evaluation:** The feedback was misleading. The icon suggested a connection even though the device wasn’t paired, so I misinterpreted the system state.
    
- **Action Model:** I had the correct goal and intention (connect headphones), but the system failed to give clear feedback, causing an error between interpreting output and choosing the next action.

## **Metaphors**

### **A) Identifying metaphors and judging their suitability**

- **Home icon:** Uses the metaphor of a house to represent “go to the main screen.” Generally a good metaphor because it is widely recognised and intuitive.
    
- **Scissors icon (Cut):** Represents physically cutting material. This is a good metaphor because it’s familiar and matches the action (removing text or objects).
    
- **Two overlapping documents (Copy/Paste):** Mimics duplicating paper sheets. Still a good, conventional metaphor, though somewhat outdated.
    
- **Plus sign (+) for “new slide”:** A simple, effective metaphor for adding something new.
    
- **Slide thumbnail icon:** Represents the metaphor of physical presentation slides. This is helpful and easy to understand.
