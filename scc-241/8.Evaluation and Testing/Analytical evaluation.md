- This approach uses models to analyze or predict performance.
    
- **Descriptive Models:** Model the task structure to analyze effort and complexity.
    
- **Predictive Models:** Examples include Fitts' Law and the **Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)**.![[Pasted image 20251028001926.png]]![[Pasted image 20251028001932.png]]
