concepts. Here’s a clear explanation and sample answers for each question:

---

### **1️⃣ Describe in one sentence how working memory and focused attention are related.**

> **Answer:** Focused attention controls what information enters working memory and keeps it active for short-term processing.

🧠 _In other words_: attention decides what you focus on, and working memory temporarily holds that focused information for thinking or problem-solving.

### **2️⃣ Give an example each for bottom-up attention and top-down attention in your interaction with computers (both visual and auditory).**

#### **Visual Attention**

- **Bottom-up (stimulus-driven):**  
    A pop-up notification flashes on your screen and immediately grabs your attention.
    
- **Top-down (goal-driven):**  
    You intentionally look for the “Save” button in a toolbar while editing a document.
    

#### **Auditory Attention**

- **Bottom-up:**  
    You hear a sudden “ping” from a chat app and instinctively look at the screen.
    
- **Top-down:**  
    You focus on listening to a tutorial video while ignoring background noise.

### **3️⃣ Explain the difference between change blindness and inattentional blindness.**

> **Change blindness:** Failing to notice a **change** in a visual scene because attention was not focused on it.  
> **Inattentional blindness:** Failing to notice a **new, unexpected object** appearing because attention was engaged elsewhere.

🧩 _Example:_

- Change blindness → Not noticing a toolbar icon changed color after a software update.
    
- Inattentional blindness → Missing a pop-up warning while concentrating on typing.

### **4️⃣ How can change blindness be avoided in user interfaces?**

> **Answer:** By making changes **salient** and **attention-grabbing**, using cues such as motion, color contrast, highlights, or animations to direct the user’s focus.

💡 _Example:_ Flash or fade-in effects when new content loads, or color highlighting when a setting is updated.
