Conditionals: _if, else if, else_  
Ternary operator (? :)  
Switch statements  
Conditionals in Javascript similar with Java/C in terms of implementation and syntax
```
// Your code goes here
let cond3 = 6;

if (cond3 < 4) {
  console.log("This won't be executed");
} else if (cond3 < 5) {
  console.log("Neither will this");
} else {
  console.log("This will be executed.", cond3 == 6 ? "So will this be" : "But not this");
}
```

_for loop  
while loop  
do...while loop  
Loop control statements (break, continue)_  
JavaScript's loops share similarities with Java and C, specifically in syntax. _break_ and _continue_ behave the same way in Javascript as in Java/C. The loop behaviours may differ though due to type coercion, truthy/falsy values, scope.  
A good practice is to use scoped variables as loop counters (see example)
```
// Loops
let control = 5;
for (let loopItr = 0; loopItr < control; loopItr++) {
  console.log("Loop itr:", loopItr, "Itr left:", control - loopItr - 1);
}

```
