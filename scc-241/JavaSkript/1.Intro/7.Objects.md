JavaScript objects are data structures that allow you to group related data and functions together. They are declared using curly braces {} and consist of key-value pairs. Objects can be accessed and manipulated using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']). They can be passed as arguments to functions, enabling you to work with complex data structures and behaviors

```javascript
// Object declared using object literal notation
let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
  //functions can be included here too
};
```

Dot notation is used to access properties and methods.

```javascript
//Use of dot notation
let name = person.name; // Access 'name'
person.age = 31;

function agePerson(personObj) {
  personObj.age++;
}
console.log(person.name+" is currently", person.age, "yrs old");
agePerson(person);
console.log(person.name+" is now", person.age, "yrs old");
```
John is currently 31 yrs old
John is now 32 yrs old
