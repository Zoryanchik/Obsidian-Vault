| **Pattern**             | **Description**                                                                                             | **Example**                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confirmshaming**      | Emotionally manipulating a user into doing something by using guilt or shame.                               | A button to decline a discount that reads: "No thanks, I'm a dog person" or "I hate saving money".        |
| **Visual Interference** | Using design elements like color, size, or placement to hide or obscure information users expect to see.    | Making a "Cancel" button faint grey while the "Keep Subscription" button is bright blue.                  |
| **Obstruction**         | Creating barriers or "hurdles" that make it hard for users to complete a task, such as closing an account.  | Making it easy to sign up but requiring multiple clicks, obscure menus, or a phone call to cancel.        |
| **Forced Action**       | Requiring a user to do something unrelated and undesirable to achieve their original goal.                  | Forcing a user to take a survey before they are allowed to opt-out of data collection.                    |
| **Hidden Costs**        | Revealing unexpected fees (taxes, shipping, or service fees) only at the final step of checkout.            | A flight that starts at $100 but jumps to $160 at the final payment screen due to "service charges".      |
| **Preselection**        | Presenting a default option that is already selected to influence the user's decision.                      | A "Sign up for marketing emails" box that is checked by default.                                          |
| **Trick Wording**       | Using confusing language or double negatives to mislead a user into taking an unintended action.            | A checkbox that says: "Do not uncheck this box if you want to keep receiving emails".                     |
| **Roach Motel**         | A design that is extremely easy to "check into" (sign up) but nearly impossible to "check out" of (cancel). | A subscription service that takes one click to join but requires a physical letter or long chat to leave. |
