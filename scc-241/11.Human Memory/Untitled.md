Here is a breakdown of those topics, structured for lecture revision.

### 1. 🧠 Compare & Contrast: Three Models of Memory

This section compares the three foundational models of memory, their components, and their limitations.

#### ### The Atkinson-Shiffrin (Multi-Store) Model (1968)

This is the classic "box-and-arrow" model that proposed memory is a linear, passive process.

- **Components:**
    
    - **Sensory Register:** A brief, high-capacity store that takes in environmental information (e.g., iconic memory for sights, echoic memory for sounds).
        
    - **Short-Term Store (STS / STM):** A store with a limited capacity (approx. 7 +/- 2 items) and short duration (approx. 15-30 seconds).
        
    - **Long-Term Store (LTS / LTM):** A vast, potentially unlimited store for information held for long periods.
        
- **Process:** Information flows linearly. Attention moves info from the Sensory Register to STM. **Rehearsal** (repeating information) is the key process that keeps info in STM and transfers it to LTM.
    
- **Contrast:** It's a simple, structural model that treats STM as a single, passive "box."

#### ### The Baddeley & Hitch (Working Memory) Model (1974)

This model isn't a replacement for the _whole_ A-S model, but a major elaboration of the **Short-Term Store**. It re-imagines STM as an _active, multi-component_ system called **Working Memory (WM)**.

- **Components:**
    
    - **Central Executive:** The "boss" of the system. It's an attentional control system that manages and coordinates the "slave systems" below. It decides what to pay attention to.
        
    - **Phonological Loop:** Deals with spoken and written material (sound). It's your "inner voice" and "inner ear" that holds and rehearses verbal information.
        
    - **Visuospatial Sketchpad:** Deals with visual and spatial information (what things look like and where they are). It's your "inner eye."
        
    - **Episodic Buffer (Added later in 2000):** A temporary store that integrates information from the other components (visual, verbal, spatial) and LTM into a single, coherent "episode" or scene.
        
- **Process:** The Central Executive actively manipulates information held in the two slave systems, allowing you to _work with_ information, not just passively hold it.
    
- **Compare/Contrast:** It explains _how_ we can do two things at once (e.g., drive—using the VSS—and listen to a podcast—using the PL) as long as they use different components. The A-S model couldn't explain this.

#### ### The Craik & Lockhart (Levels of Processing) Model (1972)

This model abandons the structural "boxes" entirely and focuses on the _process_ of encoding.

- **Components (Conceptual):** It proposes that memory is a byproduct of the _depth_ at which information is processed.
    
    - **Shallow Processing:** Based on superficial, perceptual features (e.g., "The word is in capital letters" or "The word rhymes with 'boat'"). This leads to poor memory.
        
    - **Deep (Semantic) Processing:** Based on the _meaning_ of the information and connecting it to existing knowledge (e.g., "Would this word fit in the sentence: 'He bought a...'?"). This leads to durable, long-lasting memory.
        
- **Process:** There is no "store"; there is just processing. Deeper, more meaningful processing creates a stronger memory trace.
    
- **Compare/Contrast:** It directly contradicts the A-S model's emphasis on _rehearsal_. Simply repeating a word (shallow) is far less effective than thinking about its meaning (deep).

#### ### Overall Limitations of These Models

- **Atkinson-Shiffrin:** It's now seen as far too simplistic. STM and LTM are not single stores (LTM has episodic, semantic, procedural, etc.), and rehearsal isn't the only way to encode memories.
    
- **Baddeley-Hitch:** It's an excellent model of WM, but it doesn't explain the full memory system (e.g., LTM, sensory memory). The **Central Executive** is often criticized as a "black box"—it's a very powerful component that isn't fully explained.
    
- **Levels of Processing:** The concept is somewhat circular. How do we know processing was deep? Because it was remembered well. Why was it remembered well? Because processing was deep. It describes a phenomenon well but is difficult to measure and test as a formal model.

### 2. 🖥️ UI Problems Related to Working Memory Limitations

Working Memory (as defined by Baddeley & Hitch) is the system you're actively using when interacting with an interface. Its limitations (small capacity, short duration) are the direct cause of many common usability problems.

The core issue is **high cognitive load**—forcing the user to think and remember too much.

- **Forgetting Information Between Screens:**
    
    - **The Problem:** A site asks you to remember a complex confirmation code from one page and re-type it on the next.
        
    - **WM Limitation:** The user's WM is overloaded or the information decays before they can use it.
        
- **Complex or Inconsistent Navigation:**
    
    - **The Problem:** A user gets lost in a deep website menu. They can't remember how they got to the current page or how to get back to a previous one.
        
    - **WM Limitation:** The user is trying to hold a "map" of the site in their visuospatial sketchpad and their goal in their phonological loop, and the system's complexity overloads it.
        
- **High "Interruption Cost":**
    
    - **The Problem:** A user is filling out a form, a pop-up ad or notification appears, and when they close it, they've forgotten what they were just about to type.
        
    - **WM Limitation:** The **Central Executive** is forced to switch attention. This "context switch" purges the old, in-progress task from the highly volatile WM.
        
- **Unfamiliar Jargon or Icons:**
    
    - **The Problem:** A system uses a non-standard icon for a key function (e.g., a circle instead of a floppy disk for "Save").
        
    - **WM Limitation:** The user can't rely on LTM recognition. They must actively use WM to _learn and recall_ the new, arbitrary rule ("this circle means save"), which adds to their cognitive load.
        
- **Long, Un-chunked Forms:**
    
    - **The Problem:** A single webpage asks for 30 pieces of information (name, address, phone, etc.) in one long, scrolling block.
        
    - **WM Limitation:** This is visually overwhelming and prevents "chunking" (grouping info). The user's WM is strained trying to track their progress and what's left to do.

### 3. 💡 How Interactive Systems Support Memory Retrieval

This question moves from WM to LTM retrieval. The golden rule in UI design, based on memory limitations, is **Recognition over Recall**.

> **Recall:** Forcing the user to retrieve information from their LTM "from scratch" (e.g., "Type the command to print a document.") **Recognition:** Presenting the user with a list of options and having them _recognize_ the correct one (e.g., "Here is a 'File' menu with a 'Print' option. Is this what you want?").

Recognition is _vastly_ less cognitively demanding. Here is how systems support it:

- **Menus, Icons, and Toolbars:** This is the most classic example. Instead of making you _recall_ a command (like `rm -rf /folder/`), the system shows you a trash can icon. You _recognize_ its function.
    
- **Autocomplete and Search Suggestions:** When you start typing in Google, it doesn't force you to _recall_ the exact, full search query. It provides a list of suggestions that you can _recognize_ as what you're looking for.
    
- **"Recently Viewed Items" / History:** Your browser history, a "recently opened" list in a word processor, or Amazon's "You recently viewed..." list all _externalize_ your memory. They provide you with cues to recognize a past activity, rather than forcing you to recall it.
    
- **Contextual Cues:**
    
    - **Related Items:** "Customers who bought this also bought..." provides associated links that can help you retrieve a memory or find something you forgot.
        
    - **"On This Day...":** Social media feeds use this to provide a powerful retrieval cue for your own episodic memories.
        
- **Bookmarks and Favorites:** These are user-created retrieval cues. The system allows you to "tag" an item (like a webpage) so that you can easily find it later, offloading the need to remember a complex URL.
    
- **Consistent Design:** By placing the logo in the top-left and the shopping cart in the top-right, all websites use a consistent pattern. This allows you to _recognize_ the layout and find things without having to _recall_ "where does _this specific_ site put its cart?"
