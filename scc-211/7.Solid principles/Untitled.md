- **Increased Cohesion (Good):** This is about what happens _inside_ a single module (like a class or a component). **High cohesion** means that all the parts of a module belong together and are focused on **one single, well-defined job**.
    
    - **Analogy:** A well-organized toolbox. The "screwdriver" tray _only_ contains screwdrivers. It's highly cohesive. A "junk drawer" with batteries, pens, and tape has very **low cohesion**.
        
- **Reduced Coupling (Good):** This is about the relationships _between_ different modules. **Low coupling** means that modules are as independent as possible and don't know (or care) about the inner workings of other modules.
    
    - **Analogy:** LEGO bricks. You can easily swap a red brick for a blue one without affecting the rest of the structure. They have **low coupling**. A house of cards has **high coupling**; moving one card (making one change) can cause the whole system to collapse.
