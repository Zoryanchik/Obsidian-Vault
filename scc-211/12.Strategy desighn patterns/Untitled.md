| Purpose           | Define algorithm steps | Build complex objects   |
| Focus             | **Process flow**       | **Object construction** |
| Uses inheritance? | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ Usually composition   |
| Order fixed?      | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ Flexible              |
| Output            | Behavior               | Object                  |

- **Builder** controls **how an object is built**

- **Template Method** = university exam procedure  
    → register → sit exam → get results  
    (same steps for everyone, details differ)
    
- **Builder** = building a PC  
    → choose CPU → choose GPU → choose RAM  
    (many combinations, same building process)
