"Check message" describes a function or an action the system performs, not an external role. It should be represented as a **use case** (an oval) inside the system boundary.
    
- **Error:** "File system" is shown as a use case. **Reason:** A use case (oval) represents a user-visible function or goal. A "File system" is a component or external storage system, not a goal in itself. It should be represented as an **actor** (a stick figure) outside the system boundary, similar to how "External DB" is shown.
    
- **Error:** The `<<include>>` arrow direction between "Edit system setup" and "Check availability" is incorrect. **Reason:** The arrow points _from_ "Check availability" _to_ "Edit system setup". This incorrectly implies that "Check availability" _includes_ "Edit system setup". The logic should be the reverse: "Edit system setup" _must include_ "Check availability". Therefore, the arrow should point **from** "Edit system setup" **to** "Check availability".
    
- **Error:** The `<<include>>` arrow direction between "Switch device ON" and "Use only recommended actuator" is incorrect. **Reason:** The arrow points _from_ "Use only recommended actuator" _to_ "Switch device ON". This incorrectly implies that "Use only..." is the base use case. It should be the other way around: the "Switch device ON" use case _must include_ the check for "Use only recommended actuator". The arrow should point **from** "Switch device ON" **to** "Use only recommended actuator".
    
- **Error:** The "User" actor has a direct association with the "File system" use case. **Reason:** A user (actor) interacts with the system to achieve a goal (a use case), such as "Save settings" or "View history". The system _then_ interacts with components like a file system. A user should not be directly connected to a component like "File system"; they should be connected to a use case that _uses_ the file system.
