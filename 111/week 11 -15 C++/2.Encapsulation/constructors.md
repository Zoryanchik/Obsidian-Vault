The job of the constructor is to **initialize the object** (set initial values for variables or prepare the object to be used).![[Pasted image 20250208020142.png]]
### Why No Return Type for Constructors?

- **Purpose of a Constructor:** Its job is to initialize the object, not to return anything.
- When you create an object of the class (e.g., `Car newCar;`), the constructor is automatically called to set up that object, and there is no need for a return value.
