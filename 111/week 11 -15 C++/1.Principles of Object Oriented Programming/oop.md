**Encapsulation** is a fundamental concept in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** that refers to bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a **class**. It also restricts direct access to some details of an object, protecting it from unintended modification

A **class** is like a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects. It defines what an object should have (**properties**) and what it can do (**methods**).
