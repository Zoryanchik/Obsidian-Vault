- **What it does:** It gives a specific element a unique name, like a Social Security Number or a fingerprint.
    
- **Why use it:** No other element on the page can have the same `id`. You use this when you want to target **just one specific thing** (like the main title) to change its style or control it with code.
    
- _Example from slide:_ `id="main-heading"` is used to identify the main `<h1>` title.
    

### 2. `class` (Class Name)

- **What it does:** It assigns an element to a specific group or "team".
    
- **Why use it:** Unlike `id`, many different elements can share the same `class`. It is mostly used for **CSS styling**, allowing you to give the same look (like color or font) to a whole bunch of different items at once.
    
- _Example from slide:_ `class="intro-text"` is used to style a paragraph.
    

### 3. `href` (Hypertext Reference)

- **What it does:** It specifies the destination URL for a link.
    
- **Why use it:** It tells the browser **where to go** when the user clicks the text. Without it, a link (`<a>` tag) won't take you anywhere.
    
- _Example from slide:_ `<a href="https://www.example.com">` creates a link to that website.
    

### 4. `src` (Source)

- **What it does:** It specifies the source URL for an image.
    
- **Why use it:** It tells the browser **where to find the image file** you want to display. If this is wrong or missing, the picture won't show up.
    
- _Example from slide:_ `<img src="image.jpg">` tells the browser to load the file named "image.jpg".
