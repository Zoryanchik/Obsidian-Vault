The slide shows two separate files, `Sidebar.js` and `Form.js`, which are labeled as **React components**.

- **What they are showing:** React allows you to break your User Interface (UI) into small, independent, and reusable pieces.
    
- **The example:** In the left box (`Sidebar.js`), you can see the `<Form />` tag being used inside the `Sidebar` function. This demonstrates **composition**—you can build complex UIs (like a Sidebar) by stacking simpler components (like a Form) together like Lego blocks.

**The Bottom Block:** This shows a JavaScript function called `Home()` that returns that same markup structure. This ability to mix JavaScript logic (the function) with UI markup (the HTML-like tags) is the core feature of JSX.
