- **Outer loop**: Runs from `i = 0` to `i = 100` (inclusive), which is a fixed number of iterations (101 times). This is **O(1)** because it doesn't depend on the input size `n`.
    
- **Inner loop**: Runs from `j = 1` to `j < n`, which means it iterates `n - 1` times. This is **O(n)** because it scales linearly with `n`.![[Pasted image 20250531193708.png]]
