Practice Questions… From last terms feedback – want more practice questions – particularly for time complexity Existing Questions
- Lab questions (weeks 13, 14, 16)
- Past papers – note 120 similar content to 121, but some changes https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/programme/study-assessment-progression/exams/past-exampapers/computing-and-communications-past-papers/ 
- Some more questions here: https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=44048#:~:text=Practice%20Questions%3A%20Algorit hms%20and%20Complexity 
- Added (same place as last link above): 
- Week 15 Quiz questions on time complexity with worked solutions
- More questions and worked solutions on time complexity
- For this term – labs focus on coursework task, so some “homework” questions on P, NP, NP complete and NP-hard problems.
