• Decision problems: problems for which the answer is either “yes” or “no”.
• P: Decision problems solvable in polynomial time
• NP: Decision problems with solutions that can be “checked” in polynomial time
• Remember that P ⊆ NP, but we don’t know if it’s a proper subset as we don’t know if P=NP (most people think P≠NP)
