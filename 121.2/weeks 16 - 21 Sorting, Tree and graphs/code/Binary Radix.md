#### Binary-Radix

Decimal-Radix is familiar for humans, but binary-radix (base-2) is the smallest useful radix. With binary-radix there are only two possible bins: 0’s bin and 1’s bin. For example, the array is scanned from the beginning to the end while looking at the most-significant-digit, which is the most-significant-bit (MSB) for a binary-radix. If the MSB is a zero, then the array element goes into 0’s bin, or if the MSB is a 1, then the array element goes into 1’s bin.
