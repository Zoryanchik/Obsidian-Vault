•Sentinel search and Linear search algorithms are both linear in worst-case scenario, but Sentinel search requires executing fewer operations

•Binary search algorithm is more efficient comparing to Linear and Sentinel Search algorithms (Binary logarithmic in worst case), but the input array should be sorted 

•Actual values of constants generally unimportant (except in specific circumstances)

•What we really care about is behaviour as the size of our input increases – asymptotic behaviour
