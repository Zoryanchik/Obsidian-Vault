You must be able to prove exactly **who** did **what**.

It uses procedures specifically designed to protect "information and knowledge" rather than physical hardware.

| **Who is in charge?** | The data owner (the user who created the file).                        | The System Administrator / Security Policy.                                                            |
| **Flexibility**       | **High.** Easy to share data on the fly.                               | **Low.** Very rigid and strict.                                                                        |
| **Security Level**    | **Lower.** Prone to human error (users accidentally sharing too much). | **Highest.** Prevents accidental leaks.                                                                |
| **Best Analogy**      | **Your House.** You decide who gets a key and enters your living room. | **A Military Base.** You need a specific badge to enter specific zones, regardless of who invited you. |
| **Common Use**        | Personal computers, Windows, UNIX, standard corporate networks.        | Military, Government, High-Security Intelligence systems.                                              |

It ensures that every action is "traced uniquely to that entity".
